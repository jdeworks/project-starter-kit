# AGENTS.md

## Session mode
Declare your mode at the start of every session:
- **full** — all three test tiers active, all hooks enforced, CHANGES.md required. Use for features being merged.
- **lean** — feature tests only, reduced hooks, CHANGES.md optional. Use for spikes and prototypes.

Default: **full**. To switch, state "mode: lean" at session start or read `.kit/modules/lean.md`.

## Project overview
<!-- FILL IN: one paragraph describing what this project does -->

## Tech stack
<!-- FILL IN: language, framework, database, hosting -->

## Key commands
```
make dev        # start dev server
make check      # quality pipeline (format + lint + types + deadcode + tests + health)
make e2e        # run Playwright browser tests (requires dev server running)
make verify     # full verification: check + e2e — the gold standard for "done"
make test       # run unit/integration tests only
make health     # architecture health check only
make ci         # check + build (runs in CI)
make help       # list all targets
```

## Important paths

## Reference docs — read on demand

Read these when the situation calls for it. Do not load all of them upfront.

| Doc | Read when |
|-----|-----------|
| `.kit/code-health.md` | Starting a new feature, adding files, or a file is getting large/complex |
| `.kit/testing.md` | Writing or reviewing tests; starting a new feature |
| `.kit/llm-testing.md` | Adding or modifying any code that calls an LLM |
| `.kit/changelog-protocol.md` | End of session, before compressing context, or after removing symbols |
| `.kit/context-management.md` | Context is filling up or you're about to compact |
| `.kit/research-planning.md` | Starting a non-trivial feature; unsure about architecture |
| `.kit/modules/full.md` | Switching to full mode mid-session |
| `.kit/modules/lean.md` | Switching to lean mode mid-session |
| `.kit/git-and-github.md` | Commit hygiene, branching, pre-commit hooks, PR best practices |
| `.kit/verification.md` | Defining "done" — browser checks, proof requirements, console error gate |
| `.kit/retrospective.md` | End of project/milestone — writing a "Lessons Learned" section for the README |

## Non-negotiable rules (active in all modes)

1. **No feature is done without tests.** At minimum: one passing test per exported function.
2. **Run `make verify` before declaring work complete** (or `make check` for non-UI projects). Fix all failures before stopping.
3. **CHANGES.md — track progress as you go, not just at start/end.**

   **a) START:** Before writing any code, append a started entry:
   ```
   ## [YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM] session-<id> | status: started | mode: full|lean | type: add|fix|refactor|chore
   intent: One line describing what this session will do
   ```

   **b) PROGRESS:** After completing each logical unit of work (a bug fix, a feature, a refactor
   step), append a progress line under the current session **before moving to the next task**:
   ```
   - progress: <what was done> | <files touched>
   ```
   This is lightweight — one line per chunk, not a full entry. If you removed or renamed symbols,
   note them: `- progress: Replaced OldThing with NewThing | src/foo.ts (removed: OldThing)`.
   **Do not batch progress lines at the end.** Log each chunk as you finish it.

   **c) END:** When work is complete, append a completed entry:
   ```
   ## [YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM] session-<id> | status: completed | mode: full|lean | type: add|fix|refactor|chore
   files_touched: <files you changed>
   symbols_added: <new exports, or (none)>
   symbols_removed: <deleted exports, or (none)>
   tests_added: <test files, or (none)>
   reason: One sentence summary
   health_snapshot: LOC=<n>, tests=<n>, complexity=ok|warn|fail
   ```

   **Mandatory fields:** `symbols_removed` when you delete code. `tests_added` for `type: fix`.
   **Never edit past entries.** Append only. See `.kit/changelog-protocol.md` for details.

4. **Commit early and often.** Make small, meaningful commits after each completed chunk of work.
   - One logical change per commit (a fix, a feature, a refactor step — not "did a bunch of stuff")
   - Commit **after** logging a progress line, not at session end in one giant commit
   - This creates restore points — if something goes wrong, you can roll back to the last good state
   - If you've been working for a while without committing, stop and commit what you have now
   - **Keep the working tree clean.** Every file should be either committed or gitignored — no
     long-lived untracked files. If you create a local-only file (scratch notes, TODO list,
     debug config), add it to `.gitignore` before moving on. At session end, `git status`
     should show a clean tree. Untracked files that silently accumulate across sessions are
     a source of confusion and accidental staging.

5. **Never leave `console.log` in production files.** Use a logger or remove before committing.
6. **Read the relevant doc before starting unfamiliar work** — don't guess at conventions.
7. **Every fix gets a regression test.** When you fix a bug, add a test that would have caught it. Log it in CHANGES.md with `tests_added`.
8. **Check project health at session start.** Before starting new work:
   - **Stale staged changes** — run `git diff --cached`. Staged files persist silently across
     sessions (`git checkout` won't touch them). If an abandoned session left staged deletions
     or modifications, review them first — commit what's good, `git reset HEAD` what's not.
   - **Abandoned sessions** — started but never completed. Complete them or mark as abandoned.
   - **Dead code** — symbols noted as `(removed: ...)` in progress lines or `symbols_removed` that
     still appear in source. Clean them up before starting new work.
   - **Fix hotspots** — areas with repeated fixes need better test coverage.
   See `.kit/testing.md` § Regression tests.

9. **Console errors are bugs.** If any `console.error` or uncaught exception exists in the browser, fix it before moving on. Never ignore console output.
10. **Show proof when claiming done.** Include test output, `make verify` results, or console log excerpt proving zero errors. Never claim success without verification output.
11. **Finish and verify each task before starting the next.** Do not batch multiple features into one verification pass. See `.kit/verification.md` for phase discipline.
12. **Before context compression or session end:** `make verify` must pass and work must be committed. Never compress mid-task if avoidable — compress at task boundaries.

## Hooks (Claude Code — supplementary)
Hooks run automatically via `.claude/settings.json` but are **helpers, not the enforcement**.
The rules above apply to all agents whether hooks exist or not.
- After every file edit: health check warning + auto-format
- Before context compact: changelog analysis + session summary written
- On session start: session summary + abandoned session detection
- Periodic progress + verification reminder: every ~5 messages, checks progress logging and nudges verification
- On stop: auto-drafts completed entry from git diff + progress lines; warns if e2e not run
- Pre-commit: warns if no progress lines logged for the current session
